# Cryptocurrency Portfolio

This script takes your crypto data stored in a text file and gives you a timestamped portfolio of value in the console.

How to use:

1) Access portfolio.txt here.
2) Type in the crypto ticker symbol followed by a space and the number of coins you own for each one.
3) Save the file and put it in the same directory as the script.
4) Run the script and it will pull the data from your portfolio.txt file and dispaly real time data of your portfolio's value in relation to Coin Market Cap's API (updated every 5 minutes).
5) Anytime you need to change how many coins you own, simply open your portfolio.txt file and add the data.  Run the script again and you'll see the updated real time data of your portfolio.
